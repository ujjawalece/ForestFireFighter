Fire incident is a disaster that can potentially cause the loss of life, property damage and permanent disability to the affected victim. Fire fighters are primarily tasked to handle fire incidents, but they are often exposed to higher risks when extinguishing fire, especially in hazardous environments such as in nuclear power plant, petroleum refineries, gas tanks and especially in **Forests**. The main reason why forest fire are so dangerous is that in ther initial state these fire are very hard to find as they originate in forest where noone is to monitor them. these fire cause a lot of damage to naturl resources, wildlife and also human life when they become out of control. Like recently we see in Australia. Technological innovations can be utilized to assist firefighting in these areas. Therefore, in this project we presents the development of a firefighting robot which will detect the forest fire at its very initial state and will automatically extinguish it.


## Problem description:
In most of the forest fire the fire emerges sommewhere inside a dense forest and we are unaware about the fire, And whnen we come to knoe it is very late as fire had spread very much nd it become very difficult to control it.
So, basically our aim is to make such a fire extinguishing system which can detect the fire at very early stage and then we can extinguish it.
For this we have to make a system which will monitor a whole forest 24*7 and when any unfortunate thing happens, it will alert us.
We should also have some system which will automatically extinguish fire as it might happen that human fire fighters are unable to reach at that spot in time due to some circumstances.


## Approach:
